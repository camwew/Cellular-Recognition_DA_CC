# Revisiting Adaptive Cellular Recognition Under Domain Shifts: A Contextual Correspondence View (ECCV 2024)

## ðŸ’¡ Highlights
In this work, we identify the importance of implicit correspondences across biological contexts for exploiting domain-invariant pathological composition and thereby propose to exploit the dependence over various biological structures for domain adaptive cellular recognition.
